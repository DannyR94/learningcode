<head>
    <!-- The <title> element sets the title of the page as it appears in the browser tab, 
        the title when added to favorites or bookmarks, and the title that will appear in search engine results-->

    For example this <base> element is set to link to youtube.com, and the first header of the page set to link to the trending page on that site.
    The point is to not have to type out the full URL or target for every single link.

<!-- 
    The <strong> element is to emphisize important text in a document. By defualt most browsers BOLD the text.
    The <b> element BOLDs text
        - At the moment I fail to see what functional difference is bewteen these two but the interent assures me there is an important distinction.
    The <em> element is to stress emphasis on the content it's used on. By defualt this will italicize the text.
        - Examples: "Just <em>do</em> it already!" or "We <em>had</em> to do something about it"
    The <i> element is to italicize text that set off from the normal prose. This is used on things like foreign words, fictional charactor thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning.
        - Example: "The <i>Queen Mary</i> sailed last night" 
    The <a> element defines a hyperlink
        The href attribute defines the link's destination
        The target attribute defines where to open the linked document. The defualt is "_self" which opens it in the current tab (this will happen also if no tagert attribute is specified). "_blank" opens it in a new tab.
